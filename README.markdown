# Intro to Machine Learning Project: Context-Aware Speech Textbot

This project implements a context-aware speech textbot using pre-trained Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) models. The system transcribes audio input using Whisper Tiny, generates context-aware responses with Llama 3.2 1B, and converts responses to speech using gTTS. The app is deployed via a Streamlit interface with a flask based backend for processing and a database for storing conversation history.

This README provides instructions to set up and run the code files included in the project zip, covering dependencies, required access, and execution steps for Google Colab or local environments.

## Project Overview
- **ASR Model**: Pre-trained Whisper Tiny (`openai/whisper-tiny`) for speech-to-text.
- **LLM Model**: Pre-trained Llama 3.2 1B (`meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B`) for context-aware response generation.
- **Deployment**: Streamlit app with a frontend, flask based backend, and SQLite database (`speech_textbot.db`).
- **Fine-Tuning**:
  - Whisper Tiny fine-tuned on LibriSpeech (2205 training, 271 testing files extracted).
  - Llama 3.2 1B fine-tuned on SQuAD for question-answering.

## Requirements
### Software and Libraries
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Dependencies**: Install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Key libraries include:
- **requirements.txt** (included in zip, as listed above).

### Hardware
- **Google Colab**: Needed for running the app (use A100 GPU as the same was used in the project).
- **Streamlit Account**: Free tier sufficient for inference and Streamlit app.
- **Local Machine**:
  - CPU: Minimum 8 cores, 32GB RAM.
  - GPU: NVIDIA GPU with at least 16GB VRAM.
  - Storage: At least 10GB free space for models and temporary files.

### Access Requirements
- **Hugging Face Account**:
  - Required for accessing models (`openai/whisper-tiny`, `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B`).
  - Generate a Hugging Face token at [Hugging Face Settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
  - Set token as environment variable

- **Google Colab**:
  - Google account for access.
  - Mount Google Drive to store temporary files

- **Model Access**:
  - You will need access to the meta Llama 3.2 1B Model and Whisper Tiny model on hugging face


## Usage
- Upload an audio file via the Streamlit interface (stored in the `uploads` folder as `temp_audio.wav`).
- The app transcribes the audio using Whisper Tiny, generates a response with Llama 3.2 1B.
- Conversation history is stored in `speech_textbot.db`.

## Notes
- Ensure your Hugging Face token has access to `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B`, as it is a gated model.
- Due to the size of the models and data files, as well as the limits imposed by github on repo size, we have excluded thse files. However, we have included setup scripts that may be run to download the files. In case of limited computational resources
